In Java, **operators** are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values, forming expressions. Common types include arithmetic operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) for basic math operations, comparison operators (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `>`) for evaluating conditions, logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) for combining boolean expressions, and assignment operators like `+=`, `-=`, `*=` for updating variables more concisely (e.g., `x += 5` is shorthand for `x = x + 5`). These operators make code easier to read and maintain, allowing complex expressions to be represented in a simple and efficient way.
